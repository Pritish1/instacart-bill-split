A bill split helper for Instacart written in Python using BeautifulSoup.

-> Go to the receipt page of an Instacart order, right click and open page source.
-> Copy the entire page source and paste into the input prompt.
-> Edit the recepients in the map.
-> Run the code and an google sheet will be shared with the recepients containing the order item, item price and recepients in a tabular format.
-> All recepients can then fill up the sheet and split the bill accordingly.
-> Future scope is to integrate this with Instacart API so there's no need to manually paste the page source of the receipt. This can also be integrated with Splitwise API to automatically add the dues to the respective accounts.
